You're invited to chat over coffee this week!  

Don't like coffee? ${well_then()[Math.floor(Math.random()*well_then().length)]}

${emailData.names[0]}, could you please take the lead on finding a time that works for everyone?

Please mind everyone's timezones, which are: ${allTimezones}

What should you talk about? Well that's up to you, but maybe you could talk about: ${allTopics}

P.S.
${joke()[Math.floor(Math.random()*joke().length)]}

Happy chatting!
