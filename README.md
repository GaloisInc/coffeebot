Ted Hille and I are delighted to introduce: :coffee: :robot: Coffeebot :robot: :coffee:, a bot for randomly pairing up willing participants for a weekly coffee chat! 

:coffee: **How's it work?** :coffee:
Coffeebot is opt-in. Everyone who would like to participate can sign up using [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1veuNRLwbFSkc-OQctHRoN0Z9X7NDvkuMLyJw1X5-bYw/edit?usp=sharing). Coffeebot will run early Monday morning, pairing people up and sending each participant an email letting them know who they have been scheduled to chat with, along with an optional recommendation of topics to chat about. Participants can then find a time that week to schedule a hangout for a 5-30 minute coffee chat. You can bill coffeechat time to Community. 
We're going to run coffeebot as a two week experiment and then run a Q4 to gauge ongoing interest and collect feedback-- if you would like to participate for the next two weeks please sign up!
